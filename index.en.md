Healthcare organisations such as hospitals increasingly collect information from and about patients. This can be data about incidence and survival, and about treatments options and recovery trajectories, as well as about the impact on quality of life. To be beneficial for patients, it is essential that this information is communicated in a personalised and understandable manner.

We propose to develop an intelligent software tool that automatically converts data from various sources into personalised, multimodal information presentations, combining factual text with visualisations and patient narratives.
